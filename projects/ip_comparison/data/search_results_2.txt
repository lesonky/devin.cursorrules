Title: PDF
Snippet: IPv6 security issues are quite similar to those from IPv4. That is, the security methods used with IPv4 should typically be applied to IPv6 with adaptations as required to address the differences with IPv6. Security issues associated with an IPv6 implementation will generally surface in networks that are new to IPv6, or in early

Title: IPv4 to IPv6: Challenges, solutions, and lessons - ScienceDirect
Snippet: Dual stack is a compatibility measure whose deployment permits IPv4 and IPv6 traffic to operate on the same network. The deployment of dual stack networks perpetuates the use of IPv4 addresses. So, rather than conserving scarce IPv4 resources, the deployment of dual stack permits their continued use. It is not, then, a solution to IPv4 scarcity.
